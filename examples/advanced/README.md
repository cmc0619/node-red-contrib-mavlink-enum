## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Import the example you want to try
2. Add/configure your mavlink-comms node
3. Wire according to the instructions in each flow
4. Deploy and open the dashboard
5. Start using advanced features!

## 📖 Documentation

Each flow includes:
- Detailed setup instructions in the comment node
- Usage examples
- Customization tips
- Troubleshooting guide
- Safety warnings

## ⚠️ Safety Notes

**Parameter Tool:**
- NEVER change unknown parameters
- Always note original values before changing
- Test on ground before flight
- Can brick your vehicle if used incorrectly

**Safety Monitor:**
- Helper tool, NOT a replacement for pilot awareness
- Adjust thresholds for your specific vehicle
- Test alerts before relying on them

**Mission Uploader:**
- ALWAYS verify missions before arming
- Check coordinates are correct (lat/lon not swapped!)
- Plot on map first
- Have abort plan ready

**Data Logger:**
- Check disk space regularly
- Large files can slow system
- /tmp files deleted on reboot
- Archive important logs

## 🔗 Integration

These tools work great together:

**Flight Ops Setup:**
- Safety Monitor (always running)
- Data Logger (record everything)
- Parameter Tool (quick adjustments)

**Mission Planning:**
- Mission Uploader (load waypoints)
- Safety Monitor (verify pre-flight)
- Data Logger (record mission)

**Analysis:**
- Data Logger (capture data)
- Parameter Tool (review settings)
- External tools (Python, jq, etc.)

## 💡 Tips

1. **Start Simple** - Try one tool at a time
2. **Test on Ground** - Verify everything works before flight
3. **Read Documentation** - Each flow has extensive help
4. **Customize** - Adjust thresholds and settings for your needs
5. **Practice** - Become familiar with tools before critical use
